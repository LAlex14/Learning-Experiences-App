# Learning-Experiences-App

### - This app source code is presented in the following repository: <a href="https://github.com/LAlex14/Vue-Course--Practice-">Vue-Course--Practice-</a>. In this repository I deployed it on <a href="https://lalex14.github.io/Learning-Experiences-App/">GitHub pages</a>.

### - `Learning Experiences App` helped me to understand better `HTTP requests` and learn how to work with `Firebase Realtime database`. Features that I used (in addition to those used in the app described above):

- v-model, v-else-if, v-else
- Vue Lifecycle Hooks (mounted)
- fetch() method (send, get, extract and show data)
- Showing a loading spinner and handle errors in case if something goes wrong (with v-if, v-else-if and v-else)
- firebase.google.com realtime database
